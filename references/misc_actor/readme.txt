ABOUT
-----
If you don't know what QuakeActor is, go to the Psychosoft website
and find out. If you do, keep reading.

This is the source code for the beta of QuakeActor. Because it is
only a beta, I strongly recommend you wait until version 1.0 of
QuakeActor (which will have the source released) to use this code
in any mod. You may use it however, as long as you comply with the
conditions set out below.

I recommend you have the original QuakeActor package before using
this code.

ABOUT THE CODE
--------------
Considering I've only included the files I've modified, you'll
obviously need the original Q2 3.20 source to use this. You can
get that from our website.

Anything I've modified throughout the code (except in m_actor.c)
has been clearly marked with comment lines like this:
// CYBERSLASH

Just search for those and you'll find the new code. If you have any
questions, feel free to e-mail me and ask.

CONDITIONS OF USE
-----------------
I don't really care how you use this source code, as long as:
-whatever you make is non-commercial freeware
-you e-mail me (cslash@yahoo.com) and tell me what you are
 doing with it (I'm interested to know)
-your mod contains the following text in an easily findable place (ie
 in the readme.txt or something like that)

[start]

This mod uses QuakeActor 0.9. QuakeActor is a
mod developed by Shaun 'Cyberslash' Wilson
at Psychosoft. The source code for QuakeActor
and the original QuakeActor package is freely
available at:
http://games.vision.net.au/psychosoft/

[end]

As long as you adhere to those three conditions (and id Software's
conditions in license.txt), do whatever.

DISTRIBUTION
------------
This source code may be freely distributed as long as it isn't
put on a commercial CD. If you want to put it on one, you'll have to
send me a copy of the CD. So nyaa.



I think that's all I need to say.
